## [Pendulum](https://github.com/clockworkengineer/Pendulum/blob/master/Pendulum.cpp) (E-mail Archive Program) ##

**Description**: This is a Linux command line program to log on to an IMAP server and download e-mails from a configured single mailbox, comma separated mailbox list or all mailboxes for an account. A file (.eml) is created for each e-mail in a folder with the same name as its source mailbox;  each files name being a combination of the mails UID/index prefix and the subject name. If configured it can poll the server every X minutes to download and archive any new mail. Lastly if the server disconnects it will retry the connection up to --retry times before failing with an error. 

This program is based on the code for example program ArchiveMailBox but has been re-factored heavily to enable easier future development.

## To Do List ##

1. Addition of mailbox ignore list for use with â€“all so that for instance Deleted/Junk/Spam mailboxes are not archived.
1. The ability to work with multiple servers
1. Use of threads.
1. Qt based UI (Know little about Qt but it looks like the best choice for a portable/flexible way to provide a cross platform user interface).
